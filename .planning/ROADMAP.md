## Phase Details

### Phase 1: Project Setup - COMPLETE

**Goal:** Initialize TypeScript project with Playwright and build tooling

**Requirements:** None (foundation)

**Status:** Complete (2026-01-20)
**Plans:** 4 plans executed

**Success Criteria:**
1. `npm run dev` executes TypeScript without build step
2. `npm run build` produces executable in dist/
3. Playwright launches Chromium and takes a test screenshot
4. Project structure matches architecture (src/cli, src/engine, src/devices, src/output)

**Completed Plans:**
- 01-01: Configuration files (tsconfig.json, tsup.config.ts, .gitignore, package.json)
- 01-02: Directory structure and skeleton files
- 01-03: Dependencies installed and build verified
- 01-04: Playwright smoke test verified

---

### Phase 2: Device Registry - COMPLETE

**Goal:** Define comprehensive device presets with category organization

**Requirements:** DEV-01

**Status:** Complete (2026-01-20)
**Plans:** 4 plans executed

**Success Criteria:**
1. Registry contains 50+ devices (15+ phones, 10+ tablets, 18+ desktops/laptops)
2. Each device has name, width, height, deviceScaleFactor, category
3. `getDevices()` returns all devices
4. `getDevicesByCategory('phones')` filters correctly
5. Devices include latest models (iPhone 15, Pixel 8, Galaxy S24)

**Completed Plans:**
- 02-01: Phone device definitions (24 devices)
- 02-02: Tablet device definitions (13 devices)
- 02-03: Desktop/laptop device definitions (20 devices)
- 02-04: Registry integration and unit tests

**Final Count:** 57 devices total (24 phones, 13 tablets, 20 desktops/laptops)

---

### Phase 3: Browser Engine - COMPLETE

**Goal:** Core screenshot capture with Playwright browser management

**Requirements:** SHOT-01, LOAD-01, LOAD-04

**Status:** Complete (2026-01-20)
**Plans:** 3 plans executed

**Completed Plans:**
- 03-01: BrowserManager with context management and shutdown handlers
- 03-02: captureScreenshot with network idle wait and 30s timeout
- 03-03: 26 unit tests for browser engine (37 total)

**Success Criteria:**
1. Browser launches once and creates multiple contexts
2. Page navigates to URL and waits for network idle
3. Full-page screenshot captures entire scrollable content
4. Screenshot times out after 30s on slow pages
5. Browser and contexts close cleanly

---

### Phase 4: Page Loading - COMPLETE

**Goal:** Smart waiting strategies and lazy content handling

**Requirements:** LOAD-02, LOAD-03, SHOT-03

**Status:** Complete (2026-01-20)
**Plans:** 4 plans executed

**Completed Plans:**
- 04-01: Wait buffer (500ms default) and CSS animation disabling
- 04-02: scrollForLazyContent helper with height stabilization
- 04-03: Scroll integration into captureScreenshot flow
- 04-04: 10 unit tests (6 scroll + 4 capturer page loading)

**Success Criteria:**
1. Page waits additional buffer (500ms) after network idle ✓
2. Page scrolls through content to trigger lazy loading ✓
3. CSS animations are disabled before capture ✓
4. Lazy-loaded images appear in full-page screenshots ✓
5. Scroll doesn't hang on infinite scroll pages (max iterations) ✓

---

### Phase 5: Parallel Execution

**Goal:** Concurrent screenshot captures with retry logic

**Requirements:** SHOT-02, SHOT-04

**Status:** Planned
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 05-01-PLAN.md — Executor implementation (types, retry logic, captureAllDevices)
- [ ] 05-02-PLAN.md — Executor unit tests (error classification, retry behavior, concurrency)

**Success Criteria:**
1. Multiple devices capture simultaneously (default 10 concurrent)
2. Concurrency is configurable
3. Failed captures retry 2-3 times before failing
4. Memory usage stays bounded under parallel load
5. All results collected even with partial failures

---

### Phase 6: File Output

**Goal:** Organized folder structure with descriptive file naming

**Requirements:** DEV-02, OUT-01

**Success Criteria:**
1. Output creates phones/, tablets/, pc-laptops/ subdirectories
2. Screenshots named as device-name-widthxheight.png
3. File names are filesystem-safe (no special characters)
4. Timestamped parent folder prevents overwrites
5. Output location is sensible default (./screenshots/YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss/)

---

### Phase 7: HTML Report

**Goal:** Visual report with grid layout and metadata

**Requirements:** OUT-02, OUT-03, OUT-04, OUT-05

**Success Criteria:**
1. HTML report displays all screenshots in responsive grid
2. Screenshots grouped by device category with headers
3. Thumbnails load quickly, click for full-size
4. Report shows: URL captured, timestamp, duration, device count
5. Report is self-contained (works offline, no external deps)

---

### Phase 8: CLI Interface

**Goal:** Full command-line interface with all flags

**Requirements:** CLI-01, CLI-02, CLI-03, CLI-04, LOAD-05, DEV-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. `responsive-check <url>` works with URL argument
2. `responsive-check <url> /path` captures specific page
3. `--pages /a /b /c` captures multiple pages
4. `--concurrency N` sets parallel limit
5. `--wait N` overrides wait buffer
6. `--phones-only`, `--tablets-only`, `--desktops-only` filter devices
7. `--help` shows usage
8. Invalid input shows helpful error messages

---

### Phase 9: UX Polish

**Goal:** Progress feedback, cookie handling, and error UX

**Requirements:** UX-01, UX-02, UX-03

**Success Criteria:**
1. Terminal shows progress: "Capturing 12/50: iPhone 14 Pro..."
2. Progress bar or spinner indicates activity
3. Common cookie banners auto-hidden before capture
4. Failed captures show clear error with device name and reason
5. Final summary shows success/failure counts

---

### Phase 10: Integration

**Goal:** Wire everything together, auto-open report, final polish

**Requirements:** OUT-06

**Success Criteria:**
1. Full pipeline works: CLI -> devices -> capture -> output -> report
2. Report opens automatically in default browser
3. Exit code 0 on success, non-zero on failure
4. Clean shutdown (no orphan browser processes)
5. End-to-end test with real URL passes
