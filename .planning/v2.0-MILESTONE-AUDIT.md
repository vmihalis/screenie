## Tech Debt

Non-critical items deferred for future:

### Phase 14: Landing Page
- Custom domain (screenie.xyz) DNS configuration deferred
- Will configure when ready for public announcement

### Phase 15: Documentation
- Custom domain (docs.screenie.xyz) DNS configuration deferred
- Will configure when ready for public announcement

### Phase 16: Publish
- Package name is `screenie-tool` because `screenie` was already taken on npm
- CLI binary still runs as `screenie` (users type `screenie` after install)
- This is acceptable trade-off between npm availability and CLI UX
