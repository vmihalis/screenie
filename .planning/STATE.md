## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | ESM-only with type: module | Modern Node.js standard |
| 01-01 | NodeNext module resolution | Full ESM compat with Node.js 20 |
| 01-01 | Extra strict TypeScript | noUncheckedIndexedAccess for safety |
| 01-02 | Types in dedicated files | Separation of types from implementations |
| 01-02 | ESM imports use .js extension | Node.js module resolution compatibility |
| 01-03 | Named entry in tsup config | Outputs cli.js instead of index.js |
| 01-04 | Mobile viewport 390x844 @3x for smoke test | iPhone 14 Pro equivalent, retina quality |
| 01-04 | Scripts in scripts/ directory | Development utilities kept separate |
| 02-03 | Array named `desktops` with category `pc-laptops` | Combining desktop/laptop categories per project spec |
| 02-04 | Vitest for unit testing | Fast native ESM support, minimal config |
| 03-01 | isMobile true only for phones | Tablets use desktop viewport meta tag behavior |
| 03-01 | hasTouch based on category | phones/tablets=true, pc-laptops=false |
| 03-01 | Active context tracking via Set | Idempotent close operations, proper cleanup |
| 03-02 | Timeout split 80/20 navigation/screenshot | Navigation is slow part, screenshot is fast once loaded |
| 03-02 | Return error in result vs throw | Allows batch operations to continue on individual failures |
| 03-02 | scale: 'css' for screenshots | Consistent file sizes across DPRs |
| 03-03 | Non-routable IP for timeout tests | 10.255.255.1 causes reliable connection timeout vs short timeout on fast sites |
| 03-03 | Integration-style tests with real browser | Verifies actual Playwright behavior, not mocked |
| 04-01 | waitBuffer defaults to 500ms | Reasonable balance between speed and stability |
| 04-01 | Timeout budget 70/15/15 split | Navigation/buffer+scroll/screenshot to accommodate buffer |
| 04-01 | animations: 'disabled' for all screenshots | Playwright built-in handles finite/infinite correctly |
| 04-02 | 80% viewport overlap for scroll steps | Ensures lazy images near edges are triggered |
| 04-02 | 100ms delay per scroll step | Fast but gives lazy loaders time to trigger |
| 04-02 | 2s networkidle wait after each pass | Short wait to catch triggered loads (fails gracefully) |
| 04-03 | Timeout budget 60/25/15 split | Navigation/scroll/screenshot to allow more scroll time |
| 04-03 | scrollForLazy defaults true | Most pages benefit from lazy content triggering |
| 04-03 | maxScrollIterations defaults 10 | Prevents infinite scroll from hanging captures |
| 04-04 | Local HTML content for scroll tests | Uses page.setContent() for controlled test scenarios |
| 04-04 | Fresh browser context per test | createPage() helper ensures test isolation |
| 05-01 | Inline retry vs p-retry | Function returns errors not throws, simpler inline loop |
| 05-01 | NON_RETRYABLE_PATTERNS const | DNS, SSL, 404, 403, 401 classified as permanent failures |
| 05-01 | onProgress callback in ExecutionOptions | Prepared for Phase 9 CLI progress indicators |
| 05-01 | Promise.allSettled over Promise.all | Collect all results even with partial failures |
| 05-02 | Integration tests with real browser | Same pattern as capturer.test.ts for executor tests |
| 05-02 | Concurrency verification via progress callback | Track concurrent executions to verify limit respected |
| 06-01 | No external dependencies for file operations | Node.js built-ins sufficient for controlled device names |
| 06-01 | Timestamp format YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss | Windows compatibility (no colons in filename) |
| 06-01 | Create all category directories upfront | Consistent structure even if some categories empty |
| 06-02 | Temp directory for file tests | Use .test-output with afterEach cleanup |
| 06-02 | PNG magic byte verification | Verify 0x89 PNG header in file tests |
| 07-01 | CSS-only lightbox with :target | No JavaScript, meets offline/no-deps requirement |
| 07-01 | Base64 data URIs for embedding | Self-contained HTML, ~33% size overhead |
| 07-01 | CSS Grid auto-fit/minmax(280px, 1fr) | Responsive columns without media queries |
| 07-01 | Fixed category order | phones, tablets, pc-laptops for consistent display |
| 07-01 | Thumbnail aspect ratio 16/10 | Good balance for page tops with object-fit cover |
| 07-02 | Test private functions via public exports | Verify template output indirectly through generateReport |
| 07-02 | Consistent temp directory pattern | .test-output-reporter with cleanup matches organizer.test.ts |
| 08-01 | Validation throws with helpful error messages | Include examples in error messages for better UX |
| 08-01 | Device filters combine via union | --phones-only --tablets-only = phones + tablets |
| 08-01 | --pages takes precedence over path argument | Clear priority when both provided |
| 08-01 | createProgram factory for testability | Allows testing without global state |
| 08-02 | Progress output via stdout.write with carriage return | Phase 9 will add spinner |
| 08-02 | Browser cleanup in finally block | Ensures resources released even on error |
| 08-02 | Re-exports in index.ts for testability | Allows importing from cli/index.js in tests |
| 08-03 | Fresh Commander instance per test | Prevents state leakage between tests |
| 08-03 | Test validates behavior not implementation | Use error regex patterns not exact strings |
| 09-02 | CSS injection over JavaScript removal | More reliable, doesn't require waiting for elements |
| 09-02 | Default true for hideCookieBanners | Most users want clean screenshots |
| 09-02 | 50+ selectors for cookie banners | Covers OneTrust, Cookiebot, Didomi, TrustArc, etc. |
| 09-03 | Error type categorization | dns, ssl, connection, timeout, http, url, unknown |
| 09-03 | Truncate unknown errors at 60 chars | Prevent terminal flooding |
| 09-03 | Hints only for known error types | Actionable guidance like '--wait' flag |
