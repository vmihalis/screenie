## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

v2.0 decisions:
- Stack: Vanilla HTML/CSS for landing, VitePress for docs
- Flat structure (no monorepo migration)
- VHS for terminal recording
- Package renamed to "screenie" for npm identity
- Files whitelist ["dist"] for npm security
- MIT license for open source distribution
- CLI branding updated to match npm package name (screenie)
- Demo uses Catppuccin Mocha theme for modern appearance
- Demo uses --phones-only flag for short capture time
- README uses HTML p tag for centered demo GIF (GitHub markdown limitation)
- Four shields.io badges: version, downloads, license, Node.js
- Landing page uses inline CSS for zero external requests (performance)
- System fonts for landing page (no custom fonts, instant render)
- No lazy loading on above-fold demo GIF (optimal LCP score)
- Netlify static hosting with security headers and asset caching
