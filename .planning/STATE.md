## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | ESM-only with type: module | Modern Node.js standard |
| 01-01 | NodeNext module resolution | Full ESM compat with Node.js 20 |
| 01-01 | Extra strict TypeScript | noUncheckedIndexedAccess for safety |
| 01-02 | Types in dedicated files | Separation of types from implementations |
| 01-02 | ESM imports use .js extension | Node.js module resolution compatibility |
| 01-03 | Named entry in tsup config | Outputs cli.js instead of index.js |
| 01-04 | Mobile viewport 390x844 @3x for smoke test | iPhone 14 Pro equivalent, retina quality |
| 01-04 | Scripts in scripts/ directory | Development utilities kept separate |
| 02-03 | Array named `desktops` with category `pc-laptops` | Combining desktop/laptop categories per project spec |
| 02-04 | Vitest for unit testing | Fast native ESM support, minimal config |
| 03-01 | isMobile true only for phones | Tablets use desktop viewport meta tag behavior |
| 03-01 | hasTouch based on category | phones/tablets=true, pc-laptops=false |
| 03-01 | Active context tracking via Set | Idempotent close operations, proper cleanup |
| 03-02 | Timeout split 80/20 navigation/screenshot | Navigation is slow part, screenshot is fast once loaded |
| 03-02 | Return error in result vs throw | Allows batch operations to continue on individual failures |
| 03-02 | scale: 'css' for screenshots | Consistent file sizes across DPRs |
