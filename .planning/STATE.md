## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | ESM-only with type: module | Modern Node.js standard |
| 01-01 | NodeNext module resolution | Full ESM compat with Node.js 20 |
| 01-01 | Extra strict TypeScript | noUncheckedIndexedAccess for safety |
| 01-02 | Types in dedicated files | Separation of types from implementations |
| 01-02 | ESM imports use .js extension | Node.js module resolution compatibility |
| 01-03 | Named entry in tsup config | Outputs cli.js instead of index.js |
| 01-04 | Mobile viewport 390x844 @3x for smoke test | iPhone 14 Pro equivalent, retina quality |
| 01-04 | Scripts in scripts/ directory | Development utilities kept separate |
| 02-03 | Array named `desktops` with category `pc-laptops` | Combining desktop/laptop categories per project spec |
| 02-04 | Vitest for unit testing | Fast native ESM support, minimal config |
| 03-01 | isMobile true only for phones | Tablets use desktop viewport meta tag behavior |
| 03-01 | hasTouch based on category | phones/tablets=true, pc-laptops=false |
| 03-01 | Active context tracking via Set | Idempotent close operations, proper cleanup |
| 03-02 | Timeout split 80/20 navigation/screenshot | Navigation is slow part, screenshot is fast once loaded |
| 03-02 | Return error in result vs throw | Allows batch operations to continue on individual failures |
| 03-02 | scale: 'css' for screenshots | Consistent file sizes across DPRs |
| 03-03 | Non-routable IP for timeout tests | 10.255.255.1 causes reliable connection timeout vs short timeout on fast sites |
| 03-03 | Integration-style tests with real browser | Verifies actual Playwright behavior, not mocked |
| 04-01 | waitBuffer defaults to 500ms | Reasonable balance between speed and stability |
| 04-01 | Timeout budget 70/15/15 split | Navigation/buffer+scroll/screenshot to accommodate buffer |
| 04-01 | animations: 'disabled' for all screenshots | Playwright built-in handles finite/infinite correctly |
| 04-02 | 80% viewport overlap for scroll steps | Ensures lazy images near edges are triggered |
| 04-02 | 100ms delay per scroll step | Fast but gives lazy loaders time to trigger |
| 04-02 | 2s networkidle wait after each pass | Short wait to catch triggered loads (fails gracefully) |
| 04-03 | Timeout budget 60/25/15 split | Navigation/scroll/screenshot to allow more scroll time |
| 04-03 | scrollForLazy defaults true | Most pages benefit from lazy content triggering |
| 04-03 | maxScrollIterations defaults 10 | Prevents infinite scroll from hanging captures |
| 04-04 | Local HTML content for scroll tests | Uses page.setContent() for controlled test scenarios |
| 04-04 | Fresh browser context per test | createPage() helper ensures test isolation |
| 05-01 | Inline retry vs p-retry | Function returns errors not throws, simpler inline loop |
| 05-01 | NON_RETRYABLE_PATTERNS const | DNS, SSL, 404, 403, 401 classified as permanent failures |
| 05-01 | onProgress callback in ExecutionOptions | Prepared for Phase 9 CLI progress indicators |
| 05-01 | Promise.allSettled over Promise.all | Collect all results even with partial failures |
| 05-02 | Integration tests with real browser | Same pattern as capturer.test.ts for executor tests |
| 05-02 | Concurrency verification via progress callback | Track concurrent executions to verify limit respected |
| 06-01 | No external dependencies for file operations | Node.js built-ins sufficient for controlled device names |
| 06-01 | Timestamp format YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss | Windows compatibility (no colons in filename) |
| 06-01 | Create all category directories upfront | Consistent structure even if some categories empty |
