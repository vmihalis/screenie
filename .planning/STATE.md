## Accumulated Decisions

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 01-01 | ESM-only with type: module | Modern Node.js standard |
| 01-01 | NodeNext module resolution | Full ESM compat with Node.js 20 |
| 01-01 | Extra strict TypeScript | noUncheckedIndexedAccess for safety |
| 01-02 | Types in dedicated files | Separation of types from implementations |
| 01-02 | ESM imports use .js extension | Node.js module resolution compatibility |
| 01-03 | Named entry in tsup config | Outputs cli.js instead of index.js |
| 01-04 | Mobile viewport 390x844 @3x for smoke test | iPhone 14 Pro equivalent, retina quality |
| 01-04 | Scripts in scripts/ directory | Development utilities kept separate |
| 02-03 | Array named `desktops` with category `pc-laptops` | Combining desktop/laptop categories per project spec |
