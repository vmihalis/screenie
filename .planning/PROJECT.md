# Screenie

## What This Is

An open source CLI tool that captures responsive screenshots across 57 device dimensions and generates HTML reports with interactive device previews for quick visual review. Published on npm as `screenie-tool` with documentation at dist-xi-virid.vercel.app and a landing page at landing-gilt-psi-18.vercel.app.

## Core Value

Instantly verify that a web app looks correct across all device sizes without manual testing - run one command, review one report.

## Current State

**Version:** v2.2 (shipped 2026-01-21)
**npm:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/screenie-tool
**Landing:** https://landing-gilt-psi-18.vercel.app
**Docs:** https://dist-xi-virid.vercel.app

The tool is complete and published. All v1.0, v2.0, v2.1, and v2.2 requirements are validated.

## Current Milestone: v3.0 Viewport-First Capture

**Goal:** Change default screenshot behavior from full-page to viewport-only, making the grid view actually scannable while relying on interactive preview for full page exploration.

**Target features:**
- Viewport-only screenshots as default behavior
- `--full-page` flag to restore full-page capture when needed
- Remove fold line indicator (redundant with viewport-only capture)
- Major version bump with clear changelog

### Active (v3.0)

- [ ] Viewport-only screenshots as default capture mode
- [ ] `--full-page` flag for original full-page behavior
- [ ] Remove fold line indicator from report
- [ ] Update documentation for new default behavior

### Future (v3.1+)

- Config file support (.responsiverc.json)
- Custom viewport definitions via config
- Output directory flag (--output)
- URL list from file input
- Element hiding via CSS selector (--hide)
- Dark mode capture (--dark-mode)
- Device presets reference documentation
- Programmatic usage guide
- CI/CD integration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Feature cards on landing page
- Example gallery showing actual reports
- Custom domain setup (screenie.xyz, docs.screenie.xyz)
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys to cycle devices in preview)
- Side-by-side comparison mode

### Out of Scope

- Hosted web application — users run CLI locally
- Backend/API — no server-side screenshot capture
- Visual regression/diff comparison — Percy/Applitools territory
- Real device cloud testing — BrowserStack domain
- User accounts/authentication — open source tool, no login
- Cross-browser (Firefox/Safari) — Chrome sufficient for layout verification
- PDF/video export — focus on screenshots + HTML
- Video recording of interactions — focus on screenshots
- Fold line toggle (removed) — viewport-only screenshots make fold line redundant

## Context

v3.0 changes the fundamental capture philosophy:
- Full-page screenshots were the original approach (v1.0-v2.2)
- For long pages, full-page screenshots become unwieldy (10,000px+ images)
- Interactive preview (added v2.1) proved more useful for exploring content
- Viewport-only screenshots enable quick visual scanning in the grid
- `--full-page` flag preserves original behavior for users who need it

Tech stack: Node.js 20+, Playwright (Chromium), TypeScript, tsup, Vitest, figlet.
7,395 LOC TypeScript, 353 tests passing.
57 device presets covering flagship phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Node.js + Playwright (Chromium) - mature, handles parallel execution well
- **Performance**: 57 screenshots in ~30-40 seconds via parallelization (10 concurrent default)
- **Page timing**: Network idle detection + 500ms buffer, 30s max timeout
- **Output**: Self-contained HTML report with base64 images (works offline)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Full-page screenshots (not viewport-only) | Catch layout issues anywhere on page | ✓ Good |
| Playwright over Puppeteer | Better API, built-in device emulation | ✓ Good |
| HTML report over folder browsing | Scanning 50+ images in grid is faster | ✓ Good |
| Parallel execution with p-limit | 57 devices sequentially ~3min; parallel ~40sec | ✓ Good |
| CSS-only lightbox | No JavaScript, self-contained HTML | ✓ Good |
| Base64 data URIs for images | Report works offline, single file | ✓ Good |
| ESM-only with NodeNext | Modern Node.js standard | ✓ Good |
| Vitest for testing | Native ESM support, fast | ✓ Good |
| ora for spinner | Non-blocking progress, clean CI output | ✓ Good |
| Error returns vs throws | Batch operations continue on individual failures | ✓ Good |
| screenie-tool npm name | screenie was taken; binary still runs as screenie | ✓ Good |
| Vercel for hosting | User preference, excellent static hosting | ✓ Good |
| VitePress for docs | Vue ecosystem, built-in search | ✓ Good |
| GitHub Actions for publish | Automated releases with provenance | ✓ Good |
| PNG dimension extraction via buffer header | No external dependencies for fold positioning | ✓ Good |
| CSS ::after pseudo-elements for fold line | Pure CSS, toggleable without JS | ✓ Good |
| Semi-transparent coral dashed line | Good contrast without being intrusive | ✓ Good |
| Native dialog element for preview modal | Built-in focus trapping, ESC, backdrop | ✓ Good |
| 10-second iframe timeout | Standard value for detecting X-Frame-Options blocking | ✓ Good |
| Separate preview button from lightbox | Preserve both features (screenshot view + live preview) | ✓ Good |
| Figlet Big font for ASCII banner | Clear readable ASCII art within 80-char width | ✓ Good |
| Commander preAction hook for custom version | Clean way to intercept --version before action runs | ✓ Good |
| Width thresholds: Big/Small/Mini/plain | Graceful degradation from 80+ to <45 columns | ✓ Good |
| Non-TTY always plain text | Pipe and CI compatibility for machine parsing | ✓ Good |
| Skip postinstall banner | Security anti-pattern (pnpm 10+ disables by default) | ✓ Good |
