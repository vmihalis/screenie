# Screenie

## What This Is

An open source CLI tool that captures responsive screenshots across 57 device dimensions and generates HTML reports for quick visual review. Published on npm as `screenie-tool` with documentation at dist-xi-virid.vercel.app and a landing page at landing-gilt-psi-18.vercel.app.

## Core Value

Instantly verify that a web app looks correct across all device sizes without manual testing - run one command, review one report.

## Current State

**Version:** v2.0 (shipped 2026-01-21)
**npm:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/screenie-tool
**Landing:** https://landing-gilt-psi-18.vercel.app
**Docs:** https://dist-xi-virid.vercel.app

The tool is complete and published. All v1.0 and v2.0 requirements are validated.

### Active

(No active requirements - next milestone planning needed)

### Future (v2.1+)

- Config file support (.responsiverc.json)
- Custom viewport definitions via config
- Output directory flag (--output)
- URL list from file input
- Element hiding via CSS selector (--hide)
- Dark mode capture (--dark-mode)
- Device presets reference documentation
- Programmatic usage guide
- CI/CD integration examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- Feature cards on landing page
- Example gallery showing actual reports
- Custom domain setup (screenie.xyz, docs.screenie.xyz)

### Out of Scope

- Hosted web application - users run CLI locally
- Backend/API - no server-side screenshot capture
- Visual regression/diff comparison - Percy/Applitools territory
- Real device cloud testing - BrowserStack domain
- User accounts/authentication - open source tool, no login
- Cross-browser (Firefox/Safari) - Chrome sufficient for layout verification
- PDF/video export - focus on screenshots + HTML

## Context

v2.0 shipped with full open source release infrastructure:
- npm package with provenance signing
- Landing page deployed to Vercel
- VitePress documentation site
- Professional README with demo GIF and badges

Tech stack: Node.js 20+, Playwright (Chromium), TypeScript, tsup, Vitest.
5,954 LOC TypeScript, 291 tests passing.
57 device presets covering flagship phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: Node.js + Playwright (Chromium) - mature, handles parallel execution well
- **Performance**: 57 screenshots in ~30-40 seconds via parallelization (10 concurrent default)
- **Page timing**: Network idle detection + 500ms buffer, 30s max timeout
- **Output**: Self-contained HTML report with base64 images (works offline)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Full-page screenshots (not viewport-only) | Catch layout issues anywhere on page | Good |
| Playwright over Puppeteer | Better API, built-in device emulation | Good |
| HTML report over folder browsing | Scanning 50+ images in grid is faster | Good |
| Parallel execution with p-limit | 57 devices sequentially ~3min; parallel ~40sec | Good |
| CSS-only lightbox | No JavaScript, self-contained HTML | Good |
| Base64 data URIs for images | Report works offline, single file | Good |
| ESM-only with NodeNext | Modern Node.js standard | Good |
| Vitest for testing | Native ESM support, fast | Good |
| ora for spinner | Non-blocking progress, clean CI output | Good |
| Error returns vs throws | Batch operations continue on individual failures | Good |
| screenie-tool npm name | screenie was taken; binary still runs as screenie | Good |
| Vercel for hosting | User preference, excellent static hosting | Good |
| VitePress for docs | Vue ecosystem, built-in search | Good |
| GitHub Actions for publish | Automated releases with provenance | Good |
