# Plan 3: Create Desktop/Laptop Device Data

<objective>
Create desktops.ts containing 18+ desktop and laptop viewport definitions covering common breakpoints, MacBooks, ultrawide monitors, and 4K displays.
</objective>

<context>
Desktop viewports represent common browser window sizes rather than specific device models.
Category is 'pc-laptops' (combining desktops and laptops per prior decisions).
Desktop displays typically use DPR 1-2.
Device naming: "Full HD Desktop (1920x1080)" or "MacBook Pro 16 inch (1728x1117)"
</context>

<tasks>
<task id="1">
Create src/devices/desktops.ts with a readonly array of Device objects. Include:

**Common Desktop Breakpoints (8 devices):**
- HD Desktop (1280x720) DPR 1
- HD Laptop (1366x768) DPR 1
- WXGA+ Laptop (1440x900) DPR 1
- HD+ Laptop (1536x864) DPR 1.25
- WSXGA+ Desktop (1680x1050) DPR 1
- Full HD Desktop (1920x1080) DPR 1
- QHD Desktop (2560x1440) DPR 1
- 4K Desktop (3840x2160) DPR 2

**MacBook Displays (4 devices):**
- MacBook Air 13 inch (1440x900) DPR 2
- MacBook Pro 13 inch (1440x900) DPR 2
- MacBook Pro 14 inch (1512x982) DPR 2
- MacBook Pro 16 inch (1728x1117) DPR 2

**Ultrawide Monitors (3 devices):**
- Ultrawide QHD (3440x1440) DPR 1
- Super Ultrawide (5120x1440) DPR 1
- Ultrawide WQHD+ (3840x1600) DPR 1

**Standard Monitor Sizes (5 devices):**
- Small Monitor (1024x768) DPR 1
- Standard Monitor (1280x1024) DPR 1
- Wide Monitor (1920x1200) DPR 1
- 5K Display (2560x1440) DPR 2
- iMac 27 inch (2560x1440) DPR 2

Total: 20 desktop/laptop devices
</task>

<task id="2">
Export the desktops array as a named export:
```typescript
import type { Device } from './types.js';

export const desktops: readonly Device[] = [
  // ... device definitions
] as const;
```
Note: The array is named `desktops` but all devices have category: 'pc-laptops'.
</task>
