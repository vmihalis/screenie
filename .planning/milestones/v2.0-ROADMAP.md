- Verified npm pack --dry-run shows only intended files
- Fixed CLI branding to match package name

### Phase 12: Demo Creation

Plans:
- [x] 12-01: Create VHS tape script and generate optimized demo GIF

**Details:**

### Phase 13: README Polish

**Goal**: README communicates value and enables instant onboarding

### Phase 14: Landing Page

**Goal**: Landing page converts visitors to users within 10 seconds
**Depends on**: Phase 12 (need demo GIF)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 14-01: Create landing page with assets and deployment config
- [x] 14-02: Deploy to Vercel (custom domain deferred)

**Details:**
- Inline CSS for zero external requests (performance)
- System fonts for instant render
- Demo GIF above fold without lazy loading
- Copy-to-clipboard install command
- Deployed to Vercel at https://landing-gilt-psi-18.vercel.app
- Custom domain (screenie.xyz) deferred for later DNS configuration

### Phase 15: Documentation

**Goal**: Developers can find answers to CLI questions without reading source
**Depends on**: Phase 11 (need accurate CLI reference from package)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01: Set up VitePress with config and create all documentation pages
- [x] 15-02: Deploy documentation to Vercel

**Details:**
- VitePress 2.0 alpha with built-in local search
- Four documentation pages: Home, Getting Started, CLI Reference, Examples
- CLI reference documents all 10 flags matching --help output
- Single sidebar navigation for linear flow
- Deployed to Vercel at https://dist-xi-virid.vercel.app
- Custom domain (docs.screenie.xyz) deferred

### Phase 16: Publish

**Goal**: Package is live on npm and discoverable via search
**Depends on**: Phases 11, 13, 14, 15 (all must be complete before publishing)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 16-01: Create GitHub Actions workflow and publish to npm with provenance

**Details:**
- Package renamed to `screenie-tool` (screenie was taken on npm)
- GitHub Actions workflow with OIDC provenance signing
- Granular access token with 2FA bypass (trusted publishers not available for new packages)
- Published with --provenance flag
- Provenance verified via Sigstore

---

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Stack: Vanilla HTML/CSS for landing, VitePress for docs
- Flat structure (no monorepo migration)
- VHS for terminal recording
- Package renamed to "screenie-tool" for npm (screenie was taken)
- Files whitelist ["dist"] for npm security
- MIT license for open source distribution
- Vercel static hosting (user preference over Netlify)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated npm publishing
- npm provenance via --provenance flag with OIDC

**Issues Resolved:**
- CLI branding inconsistency (responsive-capture vs screenie)
- Broken GitHub/npm links in landing page and docs (fixed during audit)
- npm package name collision (renamed to screenie-tool)

**Issues Deferred:**
- Custom domain (screenie.xyz) DNS configuration
- Custom domain (docs.screenie.xyz) DNS configuration

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Package name is screenie-tool but CLI binary runs as screenie (acceptable UX trade-off)
