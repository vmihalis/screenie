## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Hosted web application | Users run CLI locally — no backend needed |
| User accounts/authentication | Open source tool, no login required |
| Visual regression/diff | Percy/Applitools territory |
| Cross-browser support | Chrome sufficient for layout verification |
| Comparison table in README | Keep README focused, defer to docs |
