**Core Value:** Instantly verify that a web app looks correct across all device sizes without manual testing

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

- [ ] **SHOT-02**: Tool runs captures in parallel with configurable concurrency (default 10)
- [ ] **SHOT-03**: Tool disables CSS animations before capture for consistency
- [ ] **SHOT-04**: Tool retries failed captures automatically (2-3 attempts)

### Device Support

- [ ] **DEV-02**: Tool organizes screenshots into phones/tablets/pc-laptops folders
- [ ] **DEV-03**: Tool supports device filtering flags (--phones-only, --tablets-only, --desktops-only)

### CLI Interface

- [ ] **CLI-01**: Tool accepts base URL as required argument (localhost or remote)
- [ ] **CLI-02**: Tool accepts page path(s) to capture
- [ ] **CLI-03**: Tool supports multiple pages in one run (--pages /home /about /gallery)
- [ ] **CLI-04**: Tool supports concurrency flag (--concurrency N)

### Output & Report

- [ ] **OUT-01**: Tool saves screenshots with descriptive names (device-name-widthxheight.png)
- [ ] **OUT-02**: Tool generates HTML report with grid view of all screenshots
- [ ] **OUT-03**: Tool groups screenshots by device category in report
- [ ] **OUT-04**: Tool shows thumbnails in report for quick scanning
- [ ] **OUT-05**: Tool displays metadata in report (URL, timestamp, duration, device count)
- [ ] **OUT-06**: Tool opens report in browser automatically after capture

### Page Loading

- [ ] **LOAD-01**: Tool waits for network idle before capture
- [ ] **LOAD-02**: Tool adds configurable buffer after network idle (default 500ms)
- [ ] **LOAD-03**: Tool scrolls through page to trigger lazy-loaded content
- [ ] **LOAD-04**: Tool enforces max timeout (30s) to prevent hanging
- [ ] **LOAD-05**: Tool supports custom wait flag (--wait ms)

### UX & Polish

- **ADV-03**: Tool supports custom CSS injection before capture
- **ADV-04**: Tool supports authentication via cookies/headers

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Visual regression/diff comparison | Percy/Applitools territory, different product category |
| Real device cloud testing | BrowserStack domain, requires infrastructure |
| Interactive browser/DevTools | Responsively App niche, different use case |
| SaaS/cloud service | Keep tool simple, no infrastructure costs |
| GUI/Electron app | CLI is simpler, integrates with dev workflows |
| Cross-browser (Firefox/Safari) | Chrome sufficient for layout verification |
| PDF/video export | Scope creep, focus on screenshots + HTML |
