## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Visual regression/diff comparison | Percy/Applitools territory, different product category |
| Real device cloud testing | BrowserStack domain, requires infrastructure |
| Interactive browser/DevTools | Responsively App niche, different use case |
| SaaS/cloud service | Keep tool simple, no infrastructure costs |
| GUI/Electron app | CLI is simpler, integrates with dev workflows |
| Cross-browser (Firefox/Safari) | Chrome sufficient for layout verification |
| PDF/video export | Scope creep, focus on screenshots + HTML |
