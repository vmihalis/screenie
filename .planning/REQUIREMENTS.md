## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Fold line baked into screenshot image | CSS overlay allows toggling later, keeps images clean |
| Real device testing | BrowserStack/Sauce Labs territory, iframe emulation sufficient |
| Video recording of interactions | Focus on screenshots, video adds complexity |
| Server-side rendering of previews | CLI tool, no backend infrastructure |
| Cross-browser preview (Firefox/Safari) | Chromium iframe sufficient for layout verification |

## Traceability

Which phases cover which requirements. Updated during roadmap creation.
