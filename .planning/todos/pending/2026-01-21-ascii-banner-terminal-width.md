title: ASCII banner too wide for small terminal sizes
area: ui
files:
  - src/banner.ts
---

## Problem

The ASCII art banner generated by figlet with the "Big" font may overflow on narrow terminals (e.g., <80 columns). This could cause the version output to look broken or wrap awkwardly when users have smaller terminal windows.

## Solution

TBD - potential approaches:
- Detect terminal width and fall back to plain text if too narrow
- Use a smaller figlet font as fallback
- Truncate or abbreviate banner for narrow terminals
